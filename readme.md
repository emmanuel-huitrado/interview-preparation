# Interprep - Questionnaire
Kindly respond to each of the questions provided here, giving particular consideration to the important notes section.

### ‼️ Important Notes: 
- Generate a readme.md file in the root directory of your Git repository to address all the questions provided. Ensure the file is ***well-organized, correctly formatted, easily readable, and understandable***.
- Endeavor to solve the questions without external sources. However, if necessary, you may refer to online resources. If you do, ***articulate the answers in your own words***.
- Use Java code within distinct packages in the IntelliJ project available in your repository for answering questions (except where explicitly stated otherwise).
- Follow the prescribed naming conventions for packages and classes (coe.unosquare.interprep.<-module name->.question<-Question Number-> e.g.: coe.unosquare.interprep.oop.question1) and Java's standard naming for classes, respectively (e.g: coe.unosquare.interprep.oop.question1.Car.class)
- Utilize any tool of your choice for drawings or diagrams, and export them as images for inclusion in the readme file.
